Using ``matrix_divided``
--------------------

>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

Matrix with alphabet:
     >>> myMatrix = [[1.5, 3.2, 4], ['A', 7, 0.5]]
     >>> matrix_divided(myMatrix, 1)
     Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
     TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Must row must be same size:
     >>> myMatrix = [[2, 3, 1.5],[7, 8]]
     >>> matrix_divided(myMatrix, 2.5)
     Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
     TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

Matrix must be a List
     >>> myMatrix = [(2, 3, 4), (5, 8, 2.4, 5), (4, 7, 1)]
     >>> matrix_divided(myMatrix, 1)
     Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
     TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Div must be number:
     >>> myMatrix = [[1, 3, 4], [3, 2, 1], [3, 2, 7]]
     >>> matrix_divided(myMatrix, 'g')
     Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
     TypeError: div must be a number

Div cant be equal to 0:
     >>> matrix_divided(myMatrix, 0)
     Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
     ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Pass div as a list:
     >>> matrix_divided(myMatrix, [2])
     Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
     TypeError: div must be a number

Divide a matrix with non integer/float numbers:
    >>> matrix_divided([["1"], ["2", "3"], ["5", "6", "7"]], 10)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Dividing a matrix which some of its elements aren't integer/float numbers:
    >>> matrix_divided([[2.7, 4], ['6', 8.4], [10.1, '12'], [5.3, '10.2', 15.8]], 5)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Passing a matrix which one of its elements is an empty list:
     >>> matrix_divided([[2.1, 5.8], [], [10, -3]], 8)
     Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
     TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Pass div as decimal:
     >>> myMatrix = [[2, 4, 6, 8, 10], [10, 8, 6, 4, 2], [2, 22, 11, 44, 11]]
     >>> matrix_divided(myMatrix, 0.50)
     [[4.0, 8.0, 12.0, 16.0, 20.0], [20.0, 16.0, 12.0, 8.0, 4.0], [4.0, 44.0, 22.0, 88.0, 22.0]]

Dividing a matrix with positive and negative numbers:
     >>> myMatrix = [[-1.5, 3.1, 0], [-78, -13.7, 54]]
     >>> matrix_divided(myMatrix, 9.2)
     [[-0.16, 0.34, 0.0], [-8.48, -1.49, 5.87]]
