## Test-Driven development

** Based on the requirements of each task, we should always write the documentation (module(s) + function(s)) and tests first, before we can do any other thing

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All files should end with a new line
* All test files should be inside a folder tests
* All test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
* All tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)')
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
